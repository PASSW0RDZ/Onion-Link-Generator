# Onion URL Finder

Onion URL Finder is a Python script that generates random .onion URLs and checks their accessibility using the Tor network. Accessible URLs are saved to a file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tor

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd onion_url_finder
```

### Step 2: Install Tor

On Ubuntu 22.04, you can install Tor with the following commands:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor -y
sudo systemctl start tor
sudo systemctl enable tor
```

### Step 3: Install Python packages

Make sure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed. Then, install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:

```sh
python3 check_onions_parallel.py
```

The script will generate random .onion URLs, check their accessibility via the Tor network, and save accessible URLs to the `accessible_onions.txt` file. The process will run continuously, generating and checking URLs every second.

## Configuration

### Thread Pool Size

The script uses a thread pool to check URLs in parallel. By default, it sets the number of threads to four times the number of CPU cores. You can adjust this by modifying the `max_workers` variable in the script.

```python
cpu_cores = os.cpu_count()
max_workers = cpu_cores * 4  # Adjust based on your system's capacity
```

### Logging

The script prints the status of each URL (whether it is accessible or not) to the console. Accessible URLs are also saved to `accessible_onions.txt`.

## Notes

- Ensure that the Tor service is running before executing the script.
- The script may consume significant CPU and network resources depending on the number of threads used.
